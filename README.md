# overflow

This is an example of simple web app. I know that react code is bad...(actually it's my first project).
You can take some notes from there!

## Start Covid API
* **Run api in docker container**
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Start frontend
* **Run React app**
```
cd ./frontend/overflow/ && npm start
```
